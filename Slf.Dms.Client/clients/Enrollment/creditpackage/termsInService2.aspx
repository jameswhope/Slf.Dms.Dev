            TRUTH-IN-SERVICE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</h1>
        <h2>
            Regarding Our Non-Litigation, Litigation and Debt Settlement Services</h2>
        <p class="left">
            (1) Using the Adjusted Balance Methodi and an average consumer credit card interest
            rate (Overall Market) of 16.8% ii, this is an estimate of what you can
            expect to pay and the time it could take if you were to make a minimum monthly payment
            of either 2.5% of the balance owed or $15, whichever is greater.
            <br />
            (2) Based on the information you provided to us this is the amount that you currently
            owe your unsecured creditor(s), assuming that no increase or decrease in the amount
            has since occurred. This amount may vary if the Verified Amount differs from this
            balance. See Section E.2 of your Legal Services Agreement for additional information
            regarding how the Verified Amount is determined.
            <br />
            (3) This is an estimate of how much interest you would have to pay if you were to
            make a minimum monthly payment of either 2.5% of the balance owed or $15, whichever
            is greater.
            <br />
            (4) This is the sum of entries (2) and (3).
            <br />
            (5) This is an estimate of how long it could take you to pay off these Target Debts
            if you were to make a minimum monthly payment of either 2.5% of the balance owed
            or $15, whichever is greater.
            <br />
            (6) This shows the number of months as years by dividing the months in (5) by 12.
            <br />
            (7) Many factors affect your actual amount, including the actual amounts of your
            deposits and the order in which your creditors accept settlements. SEE IMPORTANT
            NOTES, BELOW. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY. No specific outcome or benefit is predicted
            or guaranteed.
            <br />
            (8) This statement is intended to show you some possible outcomes if we attempt
            to settle your Target Debts as part of our representation. We will compare how long
            it could take you to pay off the Target Debts if you make minimal payments on your
            debts to what possible outcomes could be if there is a successful effort to negotiate
            settlements of those Target Debts.
            <br />
            (9) A "Target Debt" is an Account which will be the subject of negotiation efforts
            once you have deposited a sufficient sum in your Deposit Account to allow negotiations
            to commence on your behalf.
            <br />
            (10) This is an estimate of the total amount that will be paid to your creditors
            to satisfy the Target Debts, depending upon the percentage of the debt they are
            willing to accept, if any. SEE IMPORTANT NOTES, BELOW.
            <br />
            (11) This is the estimated sum of the estimated Settlement Amount, Total Contingency
            Fees, Total Initial Services Fees and Total Non-Litigation Fees for each example
            given. THESE SUMS ARE FOR ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.
            <br />
            (12) This is the estimated percentage of the estimated Total Contingency Fees, Total
            Initial Services Fees and Total Non-Litigation Fees which would be due in relation
            to the estimated Total Cost in this example. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE FOR ILLUSTRATION
            PURPOSES ONLY.
            <br />
            (13) This is an estimated number of months it could take you to settle the Accounts.
            This is an estimate only, actual results may vary.
            <br />
            (14) This shows the number of months as years by dividing the months in entry (14)
            by 12.

            IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING DEBT SETTLEMENT</h3>
        <p class="bold left">
            THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOUR DEBTS ARE SETTLED, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY
            OF YOUR DEPOSITS IS CRITICAL TO THE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE ACCOUNTS. IN GENERAL,
            THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO DEPOSIT, THE SOONER WE CAN SEEK SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
            OF THE ACCOUNTS. WHILE OTHER FACTORS WE CANNOT CONTROL (SUCH AS WHAT SETTLEMENT
            A CREDITOR MAY ACCEPT, AND WHEN THEY ACCEPT IT) WILL AFFECT HOW SOON YOUR ACCOUNTS
            ARE SETTLED, YOUR DEPOSIT AMOUNTS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN YOUR SUCCESS.
