    IMPORTANT NOTES</div>
<p>
    THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOUR DEBTS ARE SETTLED, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY
    OF YOUR DEPOSITS IS CRITICAL TO THE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE ACCOUNTS. IN GENERAL,
    THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO DEPOSIT, THE SOONER WE CAN SEEK SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
    OF THE ACCOUNTS. OTHER FACTORS WE CANNOT CONTROL (SUCH AS WHAT SETTLEMENT A CREDITOR
    MAY ACCEPT, AND WHEN THEY ACCEPT IT) WILL AFFECT HOW SOON YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE SETTLED,
    YOUR DEPOSIT AMOUNTS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN YOUR SUCCESS.</p>
