        Dear {{clientname}},
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for choosing {{company}} to represent you in your efforts
        to settle your outstanding creditor debts. We look forward to working with you to
        reach your goal. It is important to understand that your engagement with our office
        requires mutual cooperation. There are three ways you can help to improve our service
        of your accounts:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Notify the firm of any changes to your household’s financial situation.</b> If there
                are any lifestyle changes due to loss of property, change of income, or new medical
                conditions that affect your financial situation (whether it affects your earning
                potential or an increase in medical costs), please notify the firm as soon as possible.
                Specific changes or a combination of changes may positively impact our ability to
                negotiate a better settlement for you.</li>
            <li><b>Notify the firm of any communication from collectors.</b> In our experience, we have
                seen that some collectors can be very aggressive and dismissive of your rights,
                so we want to ask you to make sure to work closely with us and report any phone
                calls you receive from a collector. We document these cases so that your attorneys
                can determine if collectors are violating the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act
                or other state collection laws.</li>
            <li><b>Most importantly, when the firm calls you, please return our call as soon as possible.</b>
                We may have a great settlement we need to review with you, and we will need your
                authorization to pay your creditor.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>

    IMPORTANT NOTES</div>
<p>
    THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOUR DEBTS ARE SETTLED, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY
    OF YOUR DEPOSITS IS CRITICAL TO THE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE ACCOUNTS. IN GENERAL,
    THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO DEPOSIT, THE SOONER WE CAN SEEK SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
    OF THE ACCOUNTS. SINCE THE MONTHLY SERVICE FEE STOPS ON AN ACCOUNT ONCE IT IS SETTLED
    AND CONTINGENCY FEES DUE HAVE BEEN PAID, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF
    MONTHLY SERVICE FEES YOU PAY BY ENABLING US TO NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
    SOONER. WHILE OTHER FACTORS WE CANNOT CONTROL (SUCH AS WHAT SETTLEMENT A CREDITOR
    MAY ACCEPT, AND WHEN THEY ACCEPT IT) WILL AFFECT HOW SOON YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE SETTLED,
    YOUR DEPOSIT AMOUNTS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN YOUR SUCCESS.</p>
