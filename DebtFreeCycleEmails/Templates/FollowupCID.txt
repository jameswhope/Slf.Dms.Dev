        Dear {{clientname}},
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned previously, we want to keep you up-to-date on what is happening with your client 
        file in our office, and we think the first step is helping you understand what to expect in 
        the coming months.  Please remember that you are at the beginning of a journey.  You are 
        currently building funds to build the balance in your Settlement Deposit Account (SDA).  While 
        we will be taking offers from your creditors from the beginning, we cannot actively negotiate 
        your debt until we have roughly 10% of any debt in your SDA.  This is the case because we cannot 
        counteroffer or accept offers with no funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, you should be receiving calls from the firm in the near future to review settlement 
        offers, and as mentioned above, it is important that you return our calls as soon as possible 
        as some offers are only good for 24-48 hours.  As soon as your creditor accepts payment, we 
        will send you a finalized settlement kit which includes copies of the settlement letter and 
        the payment sent to your creditor, so that you can begin to take the steps to update your credit 
        report of settled accounts. <u>This is a good feeling!</u>
    </p>
    <p>
		As soon as you’re done paying the performance-based settlement fee, the cycle starts all over 
		again, and we’ll be calling you shortly with more settlement offers!
    </p>
    <p>
		Again, thank you for taking the time to review this email.  Please keep an eye out for more 
		informative emails from the firm.  We will do our best to keep you posted by email as it’s less 
		intrusive on your time.  As always, feel free to call into Client Services to get updates as 
		often as you desire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kindest Regards,
    </p>

    IMPORTANT NOTES</div>
<p>
    THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOUR DEBTS ARE SETTLED, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY
    OF YOUR DEPOSITS IS CRITICAL TO THE EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE ACCOUNTS. IN GENERAL,
    THE MORE YOU ARE ABLE TO DEPOSIT, THE SOONER WE CAN SEEK SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
    OF THE ACCOUNTS. SINCE THE MONTHLY SERVICE FEE STOPS ON AN ACCOUNT ONCE IT IS SETTLED
    AND CONTINGENCY FEES DUE HAVE BEEN PAID, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF
    MONTHLY SERVICE FEES YOU PAY BY ENABLING US TO NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS
    SOONER. WHILE OTHER FACTORS WE CANNOT CONTROL (SUCH AS WHAT SETTLEMENT A CREDITOR
    MAY ACCEPT, AND WHEN THEY ACCEPT IT) WILL AFFECT HOW SOON YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE SETTLED,
    YOUR DEPOSIT AMOUNTS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN YOUR SUCCESS.</p>
