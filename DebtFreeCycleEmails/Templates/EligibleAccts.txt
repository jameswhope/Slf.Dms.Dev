<p>
	Thank you for engaging our firm to represent you.
</p>
<p>
	In reviewing your file, I see that you have certain unsecured debts that this firm does not represent 
	you on. Please understand that because we do not represent you on these particular debts, we will not 
	be able to communicate with the creditors holding these unsecured debts or assist you in any way to 
	resolve these debts. Should you be sued in regards to any debt we have not been hired to assist you 
	with, we will not be able to represent you in any such lawsuit. If you would like us to represent you 
	on these debts, please contact us immediately.
</p>
<p>
	Also, as you are aware, if a lawsuit is filed against you in regards to those unsecured debts we have 
	been hired to assist you with, an additional separate written agreement will be required before we can 
	represent you in court to defend you in the lawsuit. 
</p>
<p>
	Once again I would like to thank you for engaging our firm and for your time in reading this email.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you,<br/>
